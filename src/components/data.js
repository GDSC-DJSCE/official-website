    description: `GDSC DJSCE organized an event on ‚ÄúOpen Source 101‚Äù on 23rd October 2021 and was the first event of the sort by the inaugurated by the committee. It was an astounding success, several students from many different colleges and universities had tuned in sharp at 4pm in the afternoon to learn from the talented guest speaker for the event. 

      The guest speaker Mr. Soham Parekh, briefly introduced himself and gave an amazing introduction to opensource contribution. He also took some time to explain the benefits for students that can be gained through their contribution to opensource projects. He is a full time SDE at Alan AI, along with obtaining MLH Fellow internship, advised as a mentor at companies such as LetsGrowMore, Wikipedia Foundation, GSOC and has plenty of experience in the fields of DevOps, cybersecurity, machine-learning and information security awareness. He is also the co-founder and oversees the operations of DevStation, a non-profit organisation aimed at promoting open-source contributions and encouraging startups and organisations to adopt open-source software.
      
      The event was carried out in a podcast fashion rather traditional approach which had the GDSC DJSCE lead, Mr. Soham Dave communicate and question the guest speaker, Mr. Soham Parekh. Conducted on the Microsoft Teams platform, the event attracted many intrigued learners and they all gained something new and in trend skills that were parted by the speaker.
      
      The speaker highlighted the importance and need of open-source contributions as they are in demand and popular for updating yourself on latest technologies, tools & best practices emerging from the field of Open Source. Networking with peers and industry gurus and much more was discussed in depth.
      
      He spoke about the benefits of events like GSOC Wikipedia ,in general Benefits of the open source world. He also gave some stellar examples like Android open source, google chrome, Linux Operating System and distros, GitHub based on open source technologies and contributions. Advantages include it being Extendable, people can see, modify and freely distribute code to their needs, gain Hands on experience, Collaborative community being very inclusive.
      He moved ahead to throw some light on how to find repository, Know git and GitHub version control, and how 1 programming language is good enough to start open source contributions.
      The big question that was tacked on was How to start, for which he recommended students to pay attention to Hacktober fest diff projects starters for beginners to contribute
      Steps were noted starting with identifying a  project, go to issues section filter good for issues they are beginner friendly, people guide and provide resources and network. Contributor section for big companies and developer advocates will help over there. Extend someone elses opensource projects for clueless and getting feel of opensource. Importance of documentation contributions and transfer them into coding. How to manage time, GSCO reduced time to 20 hours per week from 40 hours. Get permissions from college to persue internships if you have timezone differences.
      Another question was answered was that Should we do an internship or opensource contributions, considering the pay factor, value and startups growth is exponentioal and provide much more exposure. How the community works, it is the strength , most imp factor is the networking, freedom to choose project, not oblidged to complete the project, get option to networking with industry experts from tech giants and get cool swags bonus/rewards such as hoodies, mugs and get recognition for your work
      Impact factor affects millions of people everywhere. After GSOC get option to interview with google for internship. Impacts hugely on the resume and CV, exposure from companies from all over the world not just limited to India. He also explained the differences between Internships vs opensource, relying on his own experiences and speaking freely on the same. Documentation only contributions were also highlighted.
      Timeline for a few important events were mentioned, that is March-september for GSOC  and for Outreachy summer and winter (dec). Linux foundation, Student coding programs for opensource, Importance of MLH fellowship program prep to work with adobe, facebook, github, and more companies was also shared.
      Job opportunity for opensource contributors, lot of scope and individual gets reached out from the tech giants and get interview offer.  Companies give inflated ctc, open source contributions get much more better job offers than traditional hires. Balancing personal life and work life. Remote work benefits. Talk about tech in India and how opensource empowers the tech industry.
      At the end of the event an informal quiz based on the event was organized, in total there were 3 winners. 1st place winner would get 1-1 Personal guidance session with the guest speaker and the committee lead. The reason was to get feedback on how responsive the audience was along with being attentive and understanding skills. 
      Quiz was conducted on the kahoot platform, and it was really informative and summarized the event completely. From the audience, Deep came 1st with answering all the questions correctly, ahead of Nimesh and an anonymous user as 2nd and 3rd position respectively.
      In end, the event came to a conclusion and overall leaned towards introducing students and beginners to open-source software development, along with hands on project work and technical training. The event was a success and had left all of us wanting to learn more on the topic of opensource development and contributions.
      There was a lot to takeaway from the session and it helped all of us with the bare minimum to get started with our own open source contributions.
